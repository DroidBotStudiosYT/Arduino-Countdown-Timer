# Arduino-Countdown-Timer
In this project, I created an Arduino based countdown timer, that no longer consists of a Liquid Crystal Display, but instead using a 4 digit 7 segment led display. There will be a few buttons, a passive buzzer and a few other components, but the code is more complex than my previous project, the Arduino Alarm Clock.

# How do you do this?
Press the Start button to start, Reset to reset, and you could porbably be smart enough to figure out how to use the set countdown timer buttons.

# Components
4 digit 7 segment display

Arduino Mega or Mega 2560/Arduino Due(will do fine)

Piezo Buzzer

LEDs

Resistors - 220 ohms

Push Button (push switches)
