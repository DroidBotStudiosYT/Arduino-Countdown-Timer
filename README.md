# Arduino-Countdown-Timer
In this project, I created an Arduino based countdown timer, that no longer consists of a Liquid Crystal Display, but instead using a 4 digit 7 segment led display. There will be a few buttons, a passive buzzer and a few other components, but the code is more complex than my previous project, the Arduino Alarm Clock.
